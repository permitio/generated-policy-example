An example repo of ABAC code generated by the Permit.io policy editor

This repository contains policy .rego files to demonstrate how policies being generated by Permit.io look like.
Most of the files in this repository are auto-generated by Permit.io, and the custom folder includes custom policy files.

To run these files, the repository should be configured to work with [Permit.io's GitOps feature](https://docs.permit.io/integrations/gitops/overview/).
Alternativlet these files can be uplaoded directly to OPA (As bundles), or via [OPAL](https://github.com/permitio/opal/).
